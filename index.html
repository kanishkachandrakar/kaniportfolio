            <h2>Pipelined CPU Design and Implementation [2023]</h2>
            <p>The project centered around the development and execution of a pipelined CPU architecture utilizing Xilinx 
                design tools tailored for Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Specifically, 
                it entailed the meticulous design and implementation of the initial four stages within 
                a five-stage pipelined CPU model:
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Instruction Fetch, Instruction Decode, Instruction Execute, Memory Access</span>.</p>
            <div class="imgcpu"><img src="images/CPU.png"></div>
           

                <p>Each stage was meticulously crafted to ensure seamless operation and optimal 
                performance within the pipeline. This involved rigorous testing procedures to verify 
                the correct functionality and efficiency of each stage, guaranteeing that instructions traversed 
                through the pipeline accurately and efficiently. Additionally, precise control signals were 
                integrated into each stage to govern their operations effectively and ensure precise instruction execution.</p>
                
                <p>Moreover, the project emphasized the iterative nature of the design and testing process, wherein 
                continuous refinement and optimization were pursued to achieve correctness, efficiency, and performance 
                enhancements. Ultimately, this endeavor aimed to lay the foundation for a robust and efficient pipelined CPU design tailored for FPGA implementation, 
                with a focus on maximizing speed, reliability, and resource utilization.</p>

            <h2>JBOD File Storage System [2022]</h2>
            <div class="imgdraw"><img src="images/jbod.png"></div>
            <p>
                At its essence, JBOD represents a straightforward yet powerful storage setup. Within a single enclosure, JBOD houses multiple independent disks, each functioning autonomously. Unlike traditional RAID setups that employ complex data striping and redundancy mechanisms, JBOD operates in a non-redundant manner. Each disk is treated as a separate logical volume, offering straightforward access to individual storage units without intricate data handling processes.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                Central to the efficiency of JBOD is the mdadm module, which serves as the engine driving storage operations. One of its primary functions is caching, a crucial element in enhancing performance. Through techniques like the least recently used method, caching optimizes data accessibility, thereby boosting overall system performance.
                The mdadm module facilitates seamless communication with the JBOD server. This server acts as a central hub, providing a unified interface for managing the array of hard drives within the JBOD enclosure. This centralized management streamlines storage administration, enabling users to harness the full potential of their storage infrastructure.
              </p>

                <p>
                    In essence, the JBOD system emerges as a beacon of efficiency in the realm of storage architecture. With its consolidated disk enclosure and decentralized approach to data management, JBOD offers a flexible solution for handling large volumes of data with ease. The mdadm module serves as a critical enabler in this ecosystem, ensuring seamless communication with the JBOD server and optimizing storage performance through innovative caching mechanisms. As data volumes continue to soar, JBOD stands ready to meet the evolving storage needs of modern enterprises, driving innovation and efficiency in storage infrastructure management.
